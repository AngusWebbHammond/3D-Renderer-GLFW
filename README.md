# Object Renderer

The aim of this project is to build a renderer with glfw, meant to learn how to use OpenGL and other tools for this.

## Planned Features

- Rendering of 3D objects from file.
- Utilistion of GLSL Shaders.
- Camera control.
- Light Sources.
- Other Shaders.

I would like to eventually integrate vulkan into this renderer.
